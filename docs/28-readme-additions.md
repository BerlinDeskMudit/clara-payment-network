## "Fork and build your own" callout (add after the `## Building & running` section)

```markdown
### Fork and build your own payment system

Clara Network is designed so that **county and bank engineers can fork it
and build their own payment system** with a few tweaks. The main things to
customize:

1. **BIN ranges** — configure `CLARA_BIN_TABLE` with your country's BIN
   prefixes and member institution IDs.
2. **Currency** — set your local currency in the schema and simulator configs.
3. **Member institutions** — map your banks' sort codes to `CLARA_ISSUER_ROUTES`.
4. **Settlement rules** — configure prefund accounts and the default fund.

See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-customize-for-your-own-payment-system)
for a step-by-step walkthrough.
```
